# DataScienceBlogPost
Motivation: This is the first project of term 2 of the Data Scientist NanoDegree. I chose two airbnb datasets, from seattle and boston, specifically the listings dataset of each. A blog post was published on medium with link: https://medium.com/@samifarooqui4/what-can-airbnb-data-tell-us-about-real-estate-markets-2bda0e174d9c

The three questions I had asked and wished to answer from the daIstasets were:
1.  Is there a difference in price between the Boston and Seattle airbnb listings, does that align with the real estate market in both cities?

 2a. What are top variables that influence price. 2b. Does the airbnb data and answer to question 2a reflect on both seattle and boston real estate market. 

3. What are some of the amenities that influence price the most for the Seattle dataset.
